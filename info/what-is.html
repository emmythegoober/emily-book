    <center><h1><br><br>What is the Book of Emily?<br><br></h1></center>
    <p>The Book of Emily tells the story of a world like ours, but it is not Earth. This world had elves and orcs, it had magic, but it also had nuclear weaponryâ€”and no magic is as powerful as the splitting of the atom. Few survived the <span class="tooltip-text" title="The Crisis of the Nineteenth Century was a period of global instability which ended in the Long Night of 1855 and nuclear annihilation."><u>Crisis of the Nineteenth Century. </u></span>Most of them were either extremely resilient creatures or hidden in bunkers.</p>
    <p><br>The Book of Emily is detailed reconstruction of the history of <span class="tooltip-text" title="This world."><u>Terraferma </u></span> by Emilia O. of the <span class="tooltip-text" title="One of the most important universities in the southern hemisphere of Terraferma."><u>University of Nascente Pinto</u></span>. She writes this document three thousand years after the Crisis. </p>
