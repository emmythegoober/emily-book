    <h2>Cosmogony and Cosmology of Il Tutto</h2><br><br>
    <blockquote><p>What is Il Tutto? Il Tutto is all.</p></blockquote><br>
    <p>—Old Montagnian saying</p><br><br>
    <p>I begin this work of history by talking about the greatest history we know, that being our cosmogony. By our own definition of History, the study of the past, focusing on the past of the sapient beings of Terraferma, the cosmogony of our universe would be included as a sort of history, but would usually be delegated to the exact sciences. My work will not dare to venture deep into the world of astronomy, but I will make an attempt to understand the basics of our universe's cosmogony and the one for Il Gruppo Locale. They will be separated into two chapters, one for the general cosmogony and another for how our <i>conglomeretto</i> was created.<br><br>   Our cosmological records estimate the age of our universe (what Montagnians would call <i>Il Tutto</i>) at twenty billion years old, with a margin of error of around six hundred million years. As I write this book, the oldest known <i>conglomerato</i>, that is, a system of stars, planets and other universal debris, has been designated as "Kobalt II." It's shape has been described as egg-like, it has experienced significant redshift due to being located at roughly nineteen billion four hundred million light-years from Terraferma. This discovery by João Paulo Reis from the Kingdom of Nabouro has helped us understand our universe's age like no other previous discovery has, according to him: "If any <i>conglomerato</i> is further away than Kobalt II, then its redshift was too great for human eyes! I will not be able to discover it, due to the limitations of my own flesh, but maybe one of our many species can help figure out the true nature of Il Tutto!"<br><br>The first <i>conglomeratos</i> began forming after the universe's mass of gases started cooling down enough for a force to bring them together. The knowledge of this force, known to us as "gravity," was known since before the Crisis, but the calculations for it were lost, only to be re-discovered by the second Doge of Montagna Olberto de Padova in the ninth year of the Ilberto Era. Most people in the Padovan Continent between the Crisis Year and the first year of the Ilberto Era were preoccupied with rebuilding society and could not dedicate themselves to the sciences, be they social or exact. There are records that the equation (known to the people of the Padovan continent as "Olberto's Law of Gravitation") was first found by Kolbert Al-Kishi in the Kishian continent to the west of Padova. Current academic consensus put Al-Kishi as the true re-discoverer of the Law of Gravitation.<br><br>After gravity pulled these gases towards a stable center, these gases began accumulating into large formations known as stars. Stars are gigantic structures, bigger than any planet known to us. Our main star, La Reverenda, was formed six billion years ago. Our distant twin star, La Dimenticata, was formed four billion years ago. Stars, when nearing the end of their lives, explode into great clouds, called belaformas. These belaformas spread dense materials, like iron or carbon, to the rest of the universe. When these dense materials are pulled together by gravity, they become planets. Planets can be solid or gaseous. Solid planets, like Terraferma, have crusts, a thin outer layer of rock. Gaseous planets are usually bigger than solid planets due to being formed out of gas, not solid. Terraferma, and the nearby solid planets of Venetia and Theia, were formed five billion years ago. Them, together with the gaseous planets of Nobara, Madre Maria, and Kilompo, form our <i>conglomeretto</i>, Il Gruppo Locale.</p><br><br>

    <h3>The Maizian Conglomerato</h3><br>
    <p>Terraferma, and by consequence, Il Gruppo Locale, are located on the middle arm of the Maizian conglomerato. This conglomerato, often just called "Maizi," the old Mancomunita word for corn, appears on the night sky as a bright, moderately yellow line. Religions, especially religions from the Disperse Era (DE), that being the ages immediately after the Year of Crisis and the conquering of Holzland (3892 DE), tell different stories for how Maizi was formed. I will transcribe and analyze five myths we know about in the appendix for this chapter.<br><br>The best estimates for the number of stars within Maizi is of five hundred billion stars, of all types. These estimates may be completely wrong due to the nature of estimating the amount of stars within a conglomerato, but they are what we got. We might know about the most distant of conglomeratos, but are limited in knowledge of our own! Little is known about what lies in the middle of our conglomerato, all we know is that it contains something awaiting to be discovered.<br><br>The formation of Maizi is similar to any other conglomerato and has been explained above</p><br>
    <h3>Appendix - Creation Myths</h3>
    <h4>Ypovolí (Ancient Maltos)</h4><br>
    <p>In the beginning, there was nothing but Agápi [Love], Gi [Land] and Neró [Water]. Gi and Neró, both women, procreated and birthed all that is known and unknown. From Neró's womb came the oceans, rivers and seas; from Gi's womb came everything above the water, including the skies, but those were to be handled by their son Sýnnefo [Cloud]. When the cosmos and Planítis [Old Maltosian word for Terraferma] had been created, both Gi and Neró returned to their palace in the realms above, only to awaken when needed. Agápi remained on Planítis, he, together with his daughter Zoí [Life], were tasked in populating the entirety of the world with animals and sapient beings. Zoí created plants to feed the animals she created, and then created animals that ate the animals that fed on plants. Agápi made sure these animals procreated, ensuring that they would remain on Planítis forever.<br><br>Then, came the time that Zoí and Agápi agreed on which animal would receive sapience. Agápi wanted one singular animal to be able to receive that sapience, but Zoí decided against it, creating over a hundred sapient creatures on Planítis. This infuriated her brother and caused him to advance against his sister, almost hurting her. Zoí imprisoned him for a hundred years, and during these one hundred years no creatures were born and many died. The only ones that survived were the ones with the blessing of long-life. Zoí grew desperate as her humans and gátas started dying. If they died, then there would only remain five other sapient species. She could not have this, so she freed Agápi who made them all procreate once again. Zoí grew desperate that there were not enough males to procreate with females, therefore she demanded Agápi to allow females to mate with females and males to mate with males, for which he obliged.<br><br>[Excerpt from the Northern Parchments]</p><br>
    <h4>Ahava (Harari)</h4><br>
    <p>In the beginning, there was chaos, and from this chaos came El. El saw the emptiness of chaos and created Yabeeshuet [Haririan word for Terraferma] and the skies. Now, Yabeeshuet was formless and floating on the sea of chaos, thus El anchored the lands to the ground and skies to the lands. Then El demanded light to appear, and then there was light. El understood what light meant, the purity of it, therefore he separated it from darkness, creating day and night. El saw the new land he had created on Yabeeshuet, but it was barren. El looked upon his creation and screamed, "Let there be life!" And there was life. The land flourished with plants, thousands of forms of plants.<br><br>Then El began to create animals. He began with simple creatures. To the worms, he gave them no eyes, but the ability to make the soil good. To the birds, he gave them eyes and flight, but not a mind. Then came the time to create those with a mind. "I shall create five creatures, they shall be my children and bear the ability of thought." El created the humans, the dragos, the elves, the gátas, and the gamads, and they all knew how to think. "You shall live in this land and procreate. You shall be my witness on this planet. Go forth and multiply!" And El left the creatures alone in Yabeeshuet, only to return when called.</p><br>
