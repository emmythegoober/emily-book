    <p>If you are seeing this and you are not Emmy (the real author, not the character!), take a look! These are all the notes Emmy had about creating Terraferma!</p>
    <h1>Emmy Note #1 - The World</h1>
    <p>I have noticed that I’ve been creating stuff without a proper understanding of which countries should exist in Terraferma. I don’t have a map, nor do I have map-making skills, but this doesn’t mean I can create countries willy-nilly. As I’m writing this, I have already created several entries, most of them only mention one nation, <b>Montagna</b>, which is where Emilia, Eliza, the Professoressa, Emilia’s mom, and basically 80% of the people that appear in Emilia’s logs come from.</p>
    <p>However, I have a problem when it comes to background nations, the non-Montagna places. I believe I should make a list of these nations, maybe even their continents. It should be something that I can understand, and I don’t mind if other people don’t get this, these are my notes after all. Ok, so, Montagna (which just means “mountain” in Italian, ain’t I clever?) is located on the <b>Padovan</b> continent. Now, Padova is probably gonna be an Europe analogue, but not fully, you know? I can’t just make the Hundred Years’ War but with magic, I’m not JK Rowling, I don’t do lazy worldbuilding, at least I think I don’t. </p>
    <p>Then there’s the <b>Mancomunidad</b>, which I am not sure if I want to make it a country. Then there’s <b>Bergia</b>, which should be a sort of neighbour to Montagna, kinda of a US paralel, maybe a Germany paralel, probably Germany. There’s the <b>Kingdom of Nabouro</b>, which João Paulo Reis comes from, I think we can put that in an Africa analogue, maybe Northern Africa, Egypt. The <b>Kishian</b> continent could be the Asia analogue, but I think making it predominantly Middle Eastern or Central Asian could be good.</p>
    <p>There’s several ancient nations mentioned in the first entry, like Kashi, Maltos, and Harari, but maybe those nations collapsed and shouldn’t be in the list.</p>
